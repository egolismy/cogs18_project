    "This project is set to be a simple simulation of the fight between the famous gladiator Spartacus and a beast captured from the wild land.(Or any self-created characters)\n",
    "\n",
    "A board can be seen as the arena where warriors spill their blood. Each gladiator has three types of postures when fighting with an enemy. They are charge, sneak attack, and defend. On the other hand, beasts can only have two kinds of postures: charge and defend, which are heavily depend on their hunger status. Charge wins sneak attack, sneak attack wins defend, and defend wins charge. Each duel takes 25 turns at most. Also, the duel is designed between two fighters."
